    <h1>Ground Effect: How Formula 1 Cars Maximize Aerodynamic Efficiency</h1>
    <br>
    <!--Introduction-->
    <p>Formula 1 cars are desinged with one primary goal: to go as fast as possible. However, raw engine power alone isn't enough. To achieve the higher speeds, engineers focus heavily on aerodynamics. Specifically, reducing drag while maxmizing grip. One of the most effective ways F1 cars do this is by utilizing the phenomenon known as <strong>ground effect</strong>.</p>
    <p>Aerodynamics studies the airflow around objects. In F1, it generates downforce and creates drag. Downforce pushes the car onto the track, improving cornering grip, while reducing drag improves higher speeds.</p>

    <h2>Bernoulli's Principle</h2>
    <p>Bernoulli's principles explains the relationship between air speed and pressure: faster air = lower pressure, slower air = lower pressure. This same principle can be seen in our everyday lives. When we stick our hand out of a moving car's window, we can immediately feel the air pushing against our hand. But when we put our palm down we feel less force whereas if we keep our palm forward, it feels like our hand is being pushed back. This happens because our hand slows down the air in the front (high pressure) and air around the it moves faster (low pressure). This pressure difference is what pushes your hand toward the low-pressure area. In F1, the same physics can be applied. By designing the car's underbody to accelerate airflow beneath it, engineers create a low-pressure zone under the car. This low pressure effectively sucks the car towards the ground, increasing downforce without significantly increasing drag.</p>
