    <!--Introduction-->
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Formula 1 cars are designed with one primary goal: to go as fast as possible. However, raw engine power alone
        isn't enough. To achieve the higher speeds, engineers focus heavily on <span class="medium">aerodynamics</span>.
        Specifically, reducing drag
        while maximizing grip. One of the most effective ways F1 cars do this is by utilizing the phenomenon known as
        <span class="mediumTeal">ground effect</span>.
    </p>
    <p>Aerodynamics studies the airflow around objects. In F1, it generates downforce and creates drag. <span
            class="medium">Downforce</span> pushes
        the car onto the track, improving cornering grip, while reducing <span class="medium">drag</span> improves
        higher speeds.</p>



    <!-- Bernoulli -->
    <h2 id="bernoulli">Bernoulli's Principle</h2>
    <p>Bernoulli's principle explains the relationship between air speed and pressure: <span
            class="mediumBlue">faster</span> air = lower pressure,
        <span class="mediumRed">slower</span> air = higher pressure. This same principle can be seen in our everyday
        lives. When we stick our hand out
        of a moving car's window, we can immediately feel the air pushing against our hand. But when we put our palm
        down we feel less force whereas if we keep our palm forward, it feels like our hand is being pushed back. This
        happens because our hand slows down the air in the front (high pressure) and air around it moves faster (low
        pressure). This pressure difference is what pushes your hand toward the low-pressure area. In F1, the same
        physics can be applied. By designing the car's underbody to accelerate airflow beneath it, engineers create a
        low-pressure zone under the car. This low pressure effectively sucks the car towards the ground, increasing
        downforce without significantly increasing drag.

    <!-- Venturi -->
    <h2 id="venturi">Venturi Tunnels</h2>
    <p>If faster airflow creates lower pressure, how do F1 cars take advantage of this to generate downforce? You might
        be thinking that F1 cars would utilize big wings or modify the bodywork of the car, but actually F1 engineers
        focus on the underside of the car. Specifically, the focus is on the floor's design, through <span
            class="mediumTeal">Venturi Tunnels</span>
        that
        channel and accelerate the air beneath the car.
    </p>
    <p>These sculpted channels are meticulously created to handle the air passing through the underside of the car. As
        air enters these tunnels, it is forced into the narrow throat of the tunnel and speeds up similar to
        squeezing a garden hose. As we learned from <span class="medium">Bernoulli's principle</span>, the faster air
        creates lower pressure, which
        pulls the car downwards. The <span class="mediumTeal">rear diffuser</span> at the back of the car now plays its
        crucial role. The rear diffuser,
        which is the angled section at the back of an F1 car's floor, helps manage the airflow that is leaving the
        underneath of the car. Its function is similar to that of a funnel: air
        that has been accelerated through the Venturi tunnels is allowed to expand
        gradually as it exits the car. This smooth expansion prevents turbulence,
        maintains downforce, and minimizes drag.</p>
    <p>
        Overall, by engineering this technology, engineers can generate tremendous levels of <span
            class="mediumTeal">grip</span> while
        keeping the car aerodynamically efficient. This balance is crucial in Formula 1, where every fraction of a
        second counts.

    <!-- Ground Effect -->
    <h2 id="ground-effect">Ground Effect</h2>
    <p>So far we've looked at how airflow can be manipulated to create low pressure zones under the car by utilizing
        venturi tunnels. These venturi tunnels create a phenomenon known as <span class="mediumTeal">ground
            effect</span>,
        which occurs when the car runs very low to the ground.</p>

    <p>As the car moves forward on the track, the floor and the ground together form a long, enclosed channel. The
        closer this channel is to the ground, the more pronounced the <span class="mediumTeal">Venturi effect</span>
        becomes and the more tightly
        the airflow is constrained. This forces air to move even faster through the tunnels, strengthening the low
        pressure region under the car and increasing downforce significantly. This is the reason why modern F1 cars
        don't have large external wings or dramatic aero elements on the bodywork like in the past. Instead, they rely
        heavily on ground effect aerodynamics to generate the necessary <span class="medium">downforce</span> for
        high-speed cornering.
    </p>

    <!-- Interactive Simulation -->
    <h3 id="interactive">Interactive Simulation</h3>
    <p>
        Here's what you can explore in this interactive simulation of ground effect in Formula 1 cars.
        Adjust the controls to see how different factors influence airflow and downforce:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ride Height:</strong> Lowering the car closer to the ground accelerates the airflow beneath the
            floor, increasing downforce, while raising it reduces ground effect. Notice how the airflow
            patterns change as you adjust the ride height.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Faster speeds make the airflow move quicker through the Venturi tunnel, amplifying
            pressure differences and downforce. Notice how lines get longer and the ground effect
            becomes more exaggerated as you increase speed.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Venturi Throat Width:</strong> Making the tunnel narrower accelerates air more, generating stronger
            suction. Widening it slows the air and reduces downforce.</li>
        <li><strong>Diffuser Angle:</strong> Steeper angles help the airflow expand smoothly at the rear, improving
            rear.
            downforce. Notice how the airflow changes the angle it approaches the venturi tunnels as the
            angle of the diffuser changes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Porpoising Mode:</strong> Simulates the bouncing effect caused when the airflow stalls and
            reattaches at extreme ride heights, showing the instability that teams must manage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The airflow lines in the simulation are colored <span class="mediumRed">red</span> and <span
            class="mediumBlue">blue</span> to represent pressure: red regions indicate high pressure where air slows
        down, and blue regions indicate low pressure where air accelerates.
        As you adjust the controls, notice how these regions shift and how the airflow behaves around the Venturi
        throat, diffuser, and underbody. Additionally, use the pause button to stop the simulation and analyze specific
        configurations. Hope you like the simulation I created!

    <!-- Benefits and Risks -->
    <h2 id="benefits-risks">Benefits and Risks</h2>
    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Highly Efficient Downforce</strong>: Ground effect generates downforce beneath the car rather than
            relying solely on wings, allowing F1 cars to produce enormous grip with significantly less aerodynamic drag.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Improved Straight-Line Speed</strong>: Because less downforce is created by exposed wings, cars
            experience lower drag on straights, helping them achieve higher top speeds without sacrificing cornering
            performance.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Better Racing and Closer Following</strong>: Downforce generated under the floor is less disruptive
            to the airflow behind the car, meaning trailing cars lose less grip and can follow more closely through
            corners.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Extreme Ride Height Sensitivity</strong>: Ground effect only works optimally within a narrow
            ride-height window. If the car is too high, airflow is not accelerated enough to generate strong downforce.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Porpoising and Flow Instability</strong>: When the car runs too low, airflow beneath the floor can
            stall, causing a sudden loss of downforce. As the car rises, airflow reattaches and downforce returns,
            creating a bouncing motion known as porpoising.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Setup Trade-Offs</strong>: To control porpoising, teams may be forced to raise ride height or soften
            setups, reducing the maximum ground effect potential and impacting overall performance.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- History -->
    <h2 id="history">History of Ground Effect in Formula 1</h2>
    <p>Ground effect aerodynamics has a storied history in Formula 1, marked by innovation, regulation changes, and
        ongoing development. The concept was first seriously explored in the late 1970s, with teams like Lotus
        pioneering the use of Venturi tunnels and side skirts to maximize ground effect. The Lotus 78 and later the
        Lotus 79 were revolutionary, dominating the 1978 season with their advanced ground effect designs.</p>
    <p>However, the extreme downforce generated by ground effect cars led to safety concerns, as the cars could become
        unstable if they lost ground contact. In response, the FIA introduced regulations in the early 1980s that banned
        the use of sliding skirts and imposed minimum ride heights, effectively curbing the most extreme applications of
        ground effect.</p>
    <p>Despite these regulations, ground effect principles continued to influence F1 car design. In recent years, with
        the 2022 regulations, ground effect has made a significant comeback. The new rules reintroduced Venturi tunnels
        and underfloor aerodynamics as primary sources of downforce, aiming to improve racing by reducing the
        aerodynamic wake and allowing cars to follow each other more closely.</p>
    <p>Today, ground effect remains a critical aspect of F1 aerodynamics, with teams continuously refining their
        underfloor designs to maximize performance within the regulatory framework. The ongoing evolution of ground
        effect technology highlights its enduring importance in the quest for speed and efficiency in Formula 1 racing.

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Ground effect aerodynamics has revolutionized Formula 1 car design, allowing teams to generate massive downforce
        efficiently through <span class="mediumTeal">Venturi tunnels</span> and <span class="mediumBlue">low-pressure
            zones</span> beneath the car. By optimizing airflow under the car
        and maintaining close proximity to the track, F1 cars achieve exceptional grip and performance. However, this
        technology also introduces challenges such as ride height sensitivity and porpoising that teams must carefully
        manage. Overall, <span class="medium">ground effect</span> remains a cornerstone of modern F1 engineering,
        pushing the boundaries of speed
        and handling on the racetrack.
